# Quick Summary of what is Internet

## Quick definition
Most people use the internet every day without fully understanding how it functions. Similar to electricity, you can use it without knowing the technical details.

The internet **is not a cloud** but a physical network of
- wires (including fiber optics) 
- copper networks
- satellites networks
- cell phone networks

A server is a specialized computer directly connected to the internet, hosting *web pages and files*, identified by a **unique** IP address.

## How does it work ?
Regular computers connected to the internet through internet service providers (ISPs) are called **clients**.
Information travels in packets over the internet, which are reassembled at their destination.

### Role of routers

**IP addresses and routers** play a **crucial** role in directing packets to their intended destinations.
Routers help packets move from one part of the internet to another, ensuring they reach their destination correctly.

The internet is a vast network with **multiple** routers and IP addresses, which is how data is efficiently routed.
Routers *add* and *remove* layers from packets as they traverse the internet, ensuring data reaches the right destination.
